### Introduction

The koiplot package produces scatterplots in which points are replaced by decorated rectangles called brushstrokes. Various parameters of the brushstrokes can be adjusted to plot extra variables in the data set, in a similar way to a balloon plot. Although the koiplot can be viewed as an enhanced scatterplot, its main use is not as a way of displaying data but as a way of producing artistic-looking graphics which could be used, for example, on the cover of a report.

You can get an idea of the package by running `example(koiplot)` or read the full user guide at the following link:
